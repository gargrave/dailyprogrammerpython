Description

Contrary to popular belief, the tetromino pieces you are given in a game of Tetris
are not randomly selected. Instead, all seven pieces are placed into a "bag."
A piece is randomly removed from the bag and presented to the player until the bag is empty.
When the bag is empty, it is refilled and the process is repeated for any additional
pieces that are needed.

In this way, it is assured that the player will never go too long without seeing
a particular piece. It is possible for the player to receive two identical
pieces in a row, but never three or more. Your task for today is to implement this system.
